### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Eliot! 

ðŸš€ A coding aficionado on a mission to make the digital world more awesome! Specializing in backend development and API mastery, I bring solid solutions to the table while also enjoying some frontend fun on the side.

ðŸ’» Tech Toolbox: PHP (CodeIgniter, Symfony, ApiPlatforme), JavaScript (Node.js, React, Vue3), Python (Django), HTML/CSS, Git, SQL, Domain Driven Design, Linux. 

ðŸŒ± Forever curious and always tinkering with the latest tech trends. Currently geeking out over domain driven design architectures and containerization. 

ðŸ’¼ Beyond coding, I'm all about giving back to the community and contributing to open source projects. Let's collaborate and make some digital magic happen!

ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, you can find me leveling up in video games, hitting the slopes for some skiing action, or enjoying a round of board games with friends.
